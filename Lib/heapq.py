"""Heap queue algorithm (a.k.a. priority queue).

Heaps are arrays kila which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] na a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
all k, counting elements kutoka 0.  For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
property of a heap ni that a[0] ni always its smallest element.

Usage:

heap = []            # creates an empty heap
heappush(heap, item) # pushes a new item on the heap
item = heappop(heap) # pops the smallest item kutoka the heap
item = heap[0]       # smallest item on the heap without popping it
heapify(x)           # transforms list into a heap, in-place, kwenye linear time
item = heapreplace(heap, item) # pops na rudishas smallest item, na adds
                               # new item; the heap size ni unchanged

Our API differs kutoka textbook heap algorithms kama follows:

- We use 0-based indexing.  This makes the relationship between the
  index kila a node na the indexes kila its children slightly less
  obvious, but ni more suitable since Python uses 0-based indexing.

- Our heappop() method rudishas the smallest item, sio the largest.

These two make it possible to view the heap kama a regular Python list
without surprises: heap[0] ni the smallest item, na heap.sort()
maintains the heap invariant!

[explanation by FranÃ§ois Pinard]

Heaps are arrays kila which a[k] <= a[2*k+1] na a[k] <= a[2*k+2] for
all k, counting elements kutoka 0.  For the sake of comparison,
non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.  The interesting
property of a heap ni that a[0] ni always its smallest element.

The strange invariant above ni meant to be an efficient memory
representation kila a tournament.  The numbers below are `k', sio a[k]:

                                   0

                  1                                 2

          3               4                5               6

      7       8       9       10      11      12      13      14

    15 16   17 18   19 20   21 22   23 24   25 26   27 28   29 30


In the tree above, each cell `k' ni topping `2*k+1' na `2*k+2'.  In
a usual binary tournament we see kwenye sports, each cell ni the winner
over the two cells it tops, na we can trace the winner down the tree
to see all opponents s/he had.  However, kwenye many computer applications
of such tournaments, we do sio need to trace the history of a winner.
To be more memory efficient, when a winner ni promoted, we try to
replace it by something isipokua at a lower level, na the rule becomes
that a cell na the two cells it tops contain three different items,
but the top cell "wins" over the two topped cells.

If this heap invariant ni protected at all time, index 0 ni clearly
the overall winner.  The simplest algorithmic way to remove it and
find the "next" winner ni to move some loser (let's say cell 30 kwenye the
diagram above) into the 0 position, na then percolate this new 0 down
the tree, exchanging values, until the invariant ni re-established.
This ni clearly logarithmic on the total number of items kwenye the tree.
By iterating over all items, you get an O(n ln n) sort.

A nice feature of this sort ni that you can efficiently insert new
items wakati the sort ni going on, provided that the inserted items are
not "better" than the last 0'th element you extracted.  This is
especially useful kwenye simulation contexts, where the tree holds all
incoming events, na the "win" condition means the smallest scheduled
time.  When an event schedule other events kila execution, they are
scheduled into the future, so they can easily go into the heap.  So, a
heap ni a good structure kila implementing schedulers (this ni what I
used kila my MIDI sequencer :-).

Various structures kila implementing schedulers have been extensively
studied, na heaps are good kila this, kama they are reasonably speedy,
the speed ni almost constant, na the worst case ni sio much different
than the average case.  However, there are other representations which
are more efficient overall, yet the worst cases might be terrible.

Heaps are also very useful kwenye big disk sorts.  You most probably all
know that a big sort implies producing "runs" (which are pre-sorted
sequences, which size ni usually related to the amount of CPU memory),
followed by a merging pitaes kila these runs, which merging ni often
very cleverly organised[1].  It ni very agizaant that the initial
sort produces the longest runs possible.  Tournaments are a good way
to that.  If, using all the memory available to hold a tournament, you
replace na percolate items that happen to fit the current run, you'll
produce runs which are twice the size of the memory kila random input,
and much better kila input fuzzily ordered.

Moreover, ikiwa you output the 0'th item on disk na get an input which
may sio fit kwenye the current tournament (because the value "wins" over
the last output value), it cannot fit kwenye the heap, so the size of the
heap decreases.  The freed memory could be cleverly reused immediately
kila progressively building a second heap, which grows at exactly the
same rate the first heap ni melting.  When the first heap completely
vanishes, you switch heaps na start a new run.  Clever na quite
effective!

In a word, heaps are useful memory structures to know.  I use them in
a few applications, na I think it ni good to keep a `heap' module
around. :-)

--------------------
[1] The disk balancing algorithms which are current, nowadays, are
more annoying than clever, na this ni a consequence of the seeking
capabilities of the disks.  On devices which cannot seek, like big
tape drives, the story was quite different, na one had to be very
clever to ensure (far kwenye advance) that each tape movement will be the
most effective possible (that is, will best participate at
"progressing" the merge).  Some tapes were even able to read
backwards, na this was also used to avoid the rewinding time.
Believe me, real good tape sorts were quite spectacular to watch!
From all times, sorting has always been a Great Art! :-)
