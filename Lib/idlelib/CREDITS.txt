Guido van Rossum, kama well kama being the creator of the Python language, ni the
original creator of IDLE.  Other contributors prior to Version 0.8 include
Mark Hammond, Jeremy Hylton, Tim Peters, na Moshe Zadka.

IDLE's recent development was carried out kwenye the SF IDLEfork project. The
objective was to develop a version of IDLE which had an execution environment
which could be initialized prior to each run of user code.

The IDLEfork project was initiated by David Scherer, with some help kutoka Peter
Schneider-Kamp na Nicholas Riley.  David wrote the first version of the RPC
code na designed a fast turn-around environment kila VPython.  Guido developed
the RPC code na Remote Debugger currently integrated kwenye IDLE.  Bruce Sherwood
contributed considerable time testing na suggesting improvements.

Besides David na Guido, the main developers who were active on IDLEfork
are Stephen M. Gava, who implemented the configuration GUI, the new
configuration system, na the About dialog, na Kurt B. Kaiser, who completed
the integration of the RPC na remote debugger, implemented the threaded
subprocess, na made a number of usability enhancements.

Other contributors include Raymond Hettinger, Tony Lownds (Mac integration),
Neal Norwitz (code check na clean-up), Ronald Oussoren (Mac integration),
Noam Raphael (Code Context, Call Tips, many other patches), na Chui Tey (RPC
integration, debugger integration na persistent komapoints).

Scott David Daniels, Tal Einat, Hernan Foffani, Christos Georgiou,
Jim Jewett, Martin v. LÃ¶wis, Jason Orendorff, Guilherme Polo, Josh Robb,
Nigel Rowe, Bruce Sherwood, Jeff Shute, na Weeble have submitted useful
patches.  Thanks, guys!
