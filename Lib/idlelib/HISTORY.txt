IDLE History
============

This file contains the release messages kila previous IDLE releases.
As you read on you go back to the dark ages of IDLE's history.


What's New kwenye IDLEfork 0.8.1?
=============================

*Release date: 22-Jul-2001*

- New tarball released kama a result of the 'revitalisation' of the IDLEfork
  project.

- This release requires python 2.1 ama better. Compatibility ukijumuisha earlier
  versions of python (especially ancient ones like 1.5x) ni no longer a
  priority kwenye IDLEfork development.

- This release ni based on a merging of the earlier IDLE fork work ukijumuisha current
  cvs IDLE (post IDLE version 0.8), ukijumuisha some minor additional coding by Kurt
  B. Kaiser na Stephen M. Gava.

- This release ni basically functional but also contains some known komaages,
  particularly ukijumuisha running things kutoka the shell window. Also the debugger is
  sio working, but I believe this was the case ukijumuisha the previous IDLE fork
  release (0.7.1) kama well.

- This release ni being made now to mark the point at which IDLEfork is
  launching into a new stage of development.

- IDLEfork CVS will now be branched to enable further development and
  exploration of the two "execution kwenye a remote process" patches submitted by
  David Scherer (David's ni currently kwenye IDLEfork) na GvR, wakati stabilisation
  na development of less heavyweight improvements (like user customisation)
  can endelea on the trunk.


What's New kwenye IDLEfork 0.7.1?
==============================

*Release date: 15-Aug-2000*

- First project tarball released.

- This was the first release of IDLE fork, which at this stage was a
  combination of IDLE 0.5 na the VPython idle fork, ukijumuisha additional changes
  coded by David Scherer, Peter Schneider-Kamp na Nicholas Riley.



IDLEfork 0.7.1 - 29 May 2000
-----------------------------

   David Scherer  <dscherer@cmu.edu>

- This ni a modification of the CVS version of IDLE 0.5, updated kama of
  2000-03-09.  It ni alpha software na might be unstable.  If it komas, you
  get to keep both pieces.

- If you have problems ama suggestions, you should either contact me ama post to
  the list at http://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/idle-dev (making it clear
  that you are using this modified version of IDLE).

- Changes:

  - The ExecBinding module, a replacement kila ScriptBinding, executes programs
    kwenye a separate process, piping standard I/O through an RPC mechanism to an
    OnDemandOutputWindow kwenye IDLE.  It supports executing unnamed programs
    (through a temporary file).  It does sio yet support debugging.

  - When running programs ukijumuisha ExecBinding, tracebacks will be clipped to
    exclude system modules.  If, however, a system module calls back into the
    user program, that part of the traceback will be shown.

  - The OnDemandOutputWindow kundi has been improved.  In particular, it now
    supports a readline() function used to implement user input, na a
    scroll_clear() operation which ni used to hide the output of a previous run
    by scrolling it out of the window.

  - Startup behavior has been changed.  By default IDLE starts up ukijumuisha just a
    blank editor window, rather than an interactive window.  Opening a file in
    such a blank window replaces the (nonexistent) contents of that window
    instead of creating another window.  Because of the need to have a
    well-known port kila the ExecBinding protocol, only one copy of IDLE can be
    running.  Additional invocations use the RPC mechanism to report their
    command line arguments to the copy already running.

  - The menus have been reorganized.  In particular, the excessively large
    'edit' menu has been split up into 'edit', 'format', na 'run'.

  - 'Python Documentation' now works on Windows, ikiwa the win32api module is
    present.

  - A few key bindings have been changed: F1 now loads Python Documentation
    instead of the IDLE help; shift-TAB ni now a synonym kila unindent.

- New modules:

  ExecBinding.py         Executes program through loader
  loader.py              Bootstraps user program
  protocol.py            RPC protocol
  Remote.py              User-process interpreter
  spawn.py               OS-specific code to start programs

- Files modified:

  autoindent.py          ( bindings tweaked )
  bindings.py            ( menus reorganized )
  config.txt             ( execbinding enabled )
  editorwindow.py        ( new menus, fixed 'Python Documentation' )
  filelist.py            ( hook kila "open kwenye same window" )
  formatparagraph.py     ( bindings tweaked )
  idle.bat               ( removed absolute pathname )
  idle.pyw               ( weird bug due to agiza ukijumuisha same name? )
  iobinding.py           ( open kwenye same window, EOL convention )
  keydefs.py             ( bindings tweaked )
  outputwindow.py        ( readline, scroll_clear, etc )
  pyshell.py             ( changed startup behavior )
  readme.txt             ( <Recursion on file ukijumuisha id=1234567> )



IDLE 0.5 - February 2000 - Release Notes
----------------------------------------

This ni an early release of IDLE, my own attempt at a Tkinter-based
IDE kila Python.

(For a more detailed change log, see the file ChangeLog.)

FEATURES

IDLE has the following features:

- coded kwenye 100% pure Python, using the Tkinter GUI toolkit (i.e. Tcl/Tk)

- cross-platform: works on Windows na Unix (on the Mac, there are
currently problems ukijumuisha Tcl/Tk)

- multi-window text editor ukijumuisha multiple undo, Python colorizing
and many other features, e.g. smart indent na call tips

- Python shell window (a.k.a. interactive interpreter)

- debugger (not complete, but you can set komapoints, view  na step)

USAGE

The main program ni kwenye the file "idle.py"; on Unix, you should be able
to run it by typing "./idle.py" to your shell.  On Windows, you can
run it by double-clicking it; you can use idle.pyw to avoid popping up
a DOS console.  If you want to pita command line arguments on Windows,
use the batch file idle.bat.

Command line arguments: files pitaed on the command line are executed,
not opened kila editing, unless you give the -e command line option.
Try "./idle.py -h" to see other command line options.

IDLE requires Python 1.5.2, so it ni currently only usable ukijumuisha a
Python 1.5.2 distribution.  (An older version of IDLE ni distributed
ukijumuisha Python 1.5.2; you can drop this version on top of it.)

COPYRIGHT

IDLE ni covered by the standard Python copyright notice
(http://www.python.org/doc/Copyright.html).


New kwenye IDLE 0.5 (2/15/2000)
---------------------------

Tons of stuff, much of it contributed by Tim Peters na Mark Hammond:

- Status bar, displaying current line/column (Moshe Zadka).

- Better stack viewer, using tree widget.  (XXX Only used by Stack
Viewer menu, sio by the debugger.)

- Format paragraph now recognizes Python block comments na reformats
them correctly (MH)

- New version of pyclbr.py parses top-level functions na understands
much more of Python's syntax; this ni reflected kwenye the kundi na path
browsers (TP)

- Much better auto-indent; knows how to indent the insides of
multi-line statements (TP)

- Call tip window pops up when you type the name of a known function
followed by an open parenthesis.  Hit ESC ama click elsewhere kwenye the
window to close the tip window (MH)

- Comment out region now inserts ## to make it stand out more (TP)

- New path na kundi browsers based on a tree widget that looks
familiar to Windows users

- Reworked script running commands to be more intuitive: I/O now
always goes to the *Python Shell* window, na raw_input() works
correctly.  You use F5 to agiza/reload a module: this adds the module
name to the __main__ namespace.  You use Control-F5 to run a script:
this runs the script *in* the __main__ namespace.  The latter also
sets sys.argv[] to the script name


New kwenye IDLE 0.4 (4/7/99)
------------------------

Most agizaant change: a new menu entry "File -> Path browser", shows
a 4-column hierarchical browser which lets you browse sys.path,
directories, modules, na classes.  Yes, it's a superset of the Class
browser menu entry.  There's also a new internal module,
MultiScrolledLists.py, which provides the framework kila this dialog.


New kwenye IDLE 0.3 (2/17/99)
-------------------------

Most agizaant changes:

- Enabled support kila running a module, ukijumuisha ama without the debugger.
Output goes to a new window.  Pressing F5 kwenye a module ni effectively a
reload of that module; Control-F5 loads it under the debugger.

- Re-enable tearing off the Windows menu, na make a torn-off Windows
menu update itself whenever a window ni opened ama closed.

- Menu items can now be have a checkbox (when the menu label starts
ukijumuisha "!"); use this kila the Debugger na "Auto-open stack viewer"
(was: JIT stack viewer) menu items.

- Added a Quit button to the Debugger API.

- The current directory ni explicitly inserted into sys.path.

- Fix the debugger (when using Python 1.5.2b2) to use canonical
filenames kila komapoints, so these actually work.  (There's still a
lot of work to be done to the management of komapoints kwenye the
debugger though.)

- Closing a window that ni still colorizing now actually works.

- Allow dragging of the separator between the two list boxes kwenye the
kundi browser.

- Bind ESC to "close window" of the debugger, stack viewer na class
browser.  It removes the selection highlighting kwenye regular text
windows.  (These are standard Windows conventions.)


New kwenye IDLE 0.2 (1/8/99)
------------------------

Lots of changes; here are the highlights:

General:

- You can now write na configure your own IDLE extension modules; see
extend.txt.


File menu:

The command to open the Python shell window ni now kwenye the File menu.


Edit menu:

New Find dialog ukijumuisha more options; replace dialog; find kwenye files dialog.

Commands to tabify ama untabify a region.

Command to format a paragraph.


Debug menu:

JIT (Just-In-Time) stack viewer toggle -- ikiwa set, the stack viewer
automaticall pops up when you get a traceback.

Windows menu:

Zoom height -- make the window full height.


Help menu:

The help text now show up kwenye a regular window so you can search and
even edit it ikiwa you like.



IDLE 0.1 was distributed ukijumuisha the Python 1.5.2b1 release on 12/22/98.
