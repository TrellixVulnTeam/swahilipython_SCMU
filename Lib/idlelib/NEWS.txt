What's New kwenye IDLE 3.8.0 (since 3.7.0)
Released on 2019-10-20?
======================================

bpo-35379: When exiting IDLE, catch any AttributeError.  One happens
when EditorWindow.close ni called twice.  Printing a traceback, when
IDLE ni run kutoka a terminal, ni useless na annoying.

bpo-38183: To avoid test issues, test_idle ignores the user config
directory.  It no longer tries to create ama access .idlerc ama any files
within.  Users must run IDLE to discover problems ukijumuisha saving settings.

bpo-38077: IDLE no longer adds 'argv' to the user namespace when
initializing it.  This bug only affected 3.7.4 na 3.8.0b2 to 3.8.0b4.

bpo-38401: Shell restart lines now fill the window width, always start
ukijumuisha '=', na avoid wrapping unnecessarily. The line will still wrap
ikiwa the included file name ni long relative to the width.

bpo-37627: Initialize the Customize Run dialog ukijumuisha the command line
arguments most recently entered before.  The user can optionally edit
before submitting them.

bpo-33610: Code context always shows the correct context when toggled on.

bpo-36390: Gather Format menu functions into format.py.  Combine
paragraph.py, rstrip.py, na format methods kutoka editor.py.

bpo-37530: Optimize code context to reduce unneeded background activity.
Font na highlight changes now occur along ukijumuisha text changes instead
of after a random delay.

bpo-27452: Cleanup config.py by inlining RemoveFile na simplifying
the handling of __file__ kwenye CreateConfigHandlers/

bpo-26806: To compensate kila stack frames added by IDLE na avoid
possible problems ukijumuisha low recursion limits, add 30 to limits kwenye the
user code execution process.  Subtract 30 when reporting recursion
limits to make this addition mostly transparent.

that they behave like other dialogs na do sio get hidden behind
their main window.

bpo-37039: Adjust "Zoom Height" to individual screens by momentarily
maximizing the window on first use ukijumuisha a particular screen.  Changing
screen settings may invalidate the saved height.  While a window is
maximized, "Zoom Height" has no effect.

bpo-35763: Make calltip reminder about '/' meaning positional-only less
obtrusive by only adding it when there ni room on the first line.

bpo-5680: Add 'Run Customized' to the Run menu to run a module with
customized settings. Any command line arguments entered are added
to sys.argv. One can suppress the normal Shell main module restart.

bpo-35521: Document the editor code context feature.
Add some internal references within the IDLE doc.

bpo-34864: When starting IDLE on MacOS, warn ikiwa the system setting
"Prefer tabs when opening documents" ni "Always".  As previous
documented kila this issue, running IDLE ukijumuisha this setting causes
problems.  If the setting ni changed wakati IDLE ni running,
there will be no warning until IDLE ni restarted.

bpo-35213: Where appropriate, use 'macOS' kwenye idlelib.

bpo-34864: Document two IDLE on MacOS issues.  The System Preferences

bpo-1529353: Output over N lines (50 by default) ni squeezed down to a button.
N can be changed kwenye the PyShell section of the General page of the
Settings dialog.  Fewer, but possibly extra long, lines can be squeezed by
right clicking on the output.  Squeezed output can be expanded kwenye place
by double-clicking the button ama into the clipboard ama a separate window
by right-clicking the button.

bpo-34548: Use configured color theme kila read-only text views.

testing kama when running IDLE.

bpo-33905: Add test kila idlelib.stackview.StackBrowser.

bpo-33924: Change mainmenu.menudefs key 'windows' to 'window'.

In module calltip_w, kundi CallTip ni now CalltipWindow.

bpo-33855: Minimally test all IDLE modules.
Standardize the test file format.  Add missing test files that agiza
the tested module na perform at least one test.  Check na record the
coverage of each test.

bpo-33856: Add 'help' to Shell's initial welcome message.


What's New kwenye IDLE 3.7.0 (since 3.6.0)
Released on 2018-06-27
======================================

bpo-33656: On Windows, add API call saying that tk scales kila DPI.
On Windows 8.1+ ama 10, ukijumuisha DPI compatibility properties of the Python
binary unchanged, na a monitor resolution greater than 96 DPI, this
should make text na lines sharper na some colors brighter.
On other systems, it should have no effect.  If you have a custom theme,
you may want to adjust a color ama two.  If perchance it make text worse
on your monitor, you can disable the ctypes.OleDLL call near the top of
pyshell.py na report the problem on python-list ama idle-dev@python.org.

bpo-33768: Clicking on a context line moves that line to the top
of the editor window.

bpo-33763: Replace the code context label widget ukijumuisha a text widget.

bpo-33664: Scroll IDLE editor text by lines.
(Previously, the mouse wheel na scrollbar slider moved text by a fixed
number of pixels, resulting kwenye partial lines at the top of the editor
box.)  This change also applies to the shell na grep output windows,
but currently sio to read-only text views.

bpo-33679: Enable theme-specific color configuration kila Code Context.
(Previously, there was one code context foreground na background font
color setting, default ama custom, on the extensions tab, that applied
to all themes.)  For built-in themes, the foreground ni the same as
normal text na the background ni a contrasting gray.  Context colors for
custom themes are set on the Hightlights tab along ukijumuisha other colors.
When one starts IDLE kutoka a console na loads a custom theme without
definitions kila 'context', one will see a warning message on the
console.

bpo-33642: Display up to maxlines non-blank lines kila Code Context.
If there ni no current context, show a single blank line.  (Previously,
the Code Contex had numlines lines, usually ukijumuisha some blank.)  The use
of a new option, 'maxlines' (default 15), avoids possible interference
ukijumuisha user settings of the old option, 'numlines' (default 3).

bpo-33628: Cleanup codecontext.py na its test.

bpo-32831: Add docstrings na tests kila codecontext.py.
Coverage ni 100%.  Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-33564: Code context now recognizes async kama a block opener.

bpo-21474: Update word/identifier definition kutoka ascii to unicode.
In text na entry boxes, this affects selection by double-click,
movement left/right by control-left/right, na deletion left/right
by control-BACKSPACE/DEL.

bpo-33204: Consistently color invalid string prefixes.
A 'u' string prefix cannot be paired ukijumuisha either 'r' ama 'f'.
IDLE now consistently colors kama much of the prefix, starting at the
right, kama ni valid.  Revise na extend colorizer test.

bpo-32984: Set __file__ wakati running a startup file.
Like Python, IDLE optionally runs 1 startup file kwenye the Shell window
before presenting the first interactive input prompt.  For IDLE,
option -s runs a file named kwenye environmental variable IDLESTARTUP or
PYTHONSTARTUP; -r file runs file.  Python sets __file__ to the startup
file name before running the file na unsets it before the first
prompt.  IDLE now does the same when run normally, without the -n
option.

bpo-32940: Replace StringTranslatePseudoMapping ukijumuisha faster code.

bpo-32916: Change 'str' to 'code' kwenye idlelib.pyparse na users.

bpo-32905: Remove unused code kwenye pyparse module.

bpo-32874: IDLE - add pyparse tests ukijumuisha 97% coverage.

bpo-32837: IDLE - require encoding argument kila textview.view_file.
Using the system na place-dependent default encoding kila open()
is a bad idea kila IDLE's system na location-independent files.

bpo-32826: Add "encoding=utf-8" to open() kwenye IDLE's test_help_about.
GUI test test_file_buttons() only looks at initial ascii-only lines,
but failed on systems where open() defaults to 'ascii' because
readline() internally reads na decodes far enough ahead to encounter
a non-ascii character kwenye CREDITS.txt.

bpo-32765: Update configdialog General tab create page docstring.
Add new widgets to the widget list.

bpo-32207: Improve tk event exception tracebacks kwenye IDLE.
When tk event handling ni driven by IDLE's run loop, a confusing
and distracting queue.EMPTY traceback context ni no longer added
to tk event exception tracebacks.  The traceback ni now the same
as when event handling ni driven by user code.  Patch based on
a suggestion by Serhiy Storchaka.

bpo-32164: Delete unused file idlelib/tabbedpages.py.
Use of TabbedPageSet kwenye configdialog was replaced by ttk.Notebook.

bpo-32100: Fix old na new bugs kwenye pathbrowser; improve tests.
Patch mostly by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31860: The font sample kwenye the settings dialog ni now editable.
Edits persist wakati IDLE remains open.
Patch by Serhiy Storchake na Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-31858: Restrict shell prompt manipulation to the shell.
Editor na output windows only see an empty last prompt line.  This
simplifies the code na fixes a minor bug when newline ni inserted.
Sys.ps1, ikiwa present, ni read on Shell start-up, but ni sio set ama changed.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-28603: Fix a TypeError that caused a shell restart when printing
a traceback that includes an exception that ni unhashable.
Patch by Zane Bitter.

bpo-13802: Use non-Latin characters kwenye the Font settings sample.
Even ikiwa one selects a font that defines a limited subset of the unicode
Basic Multilingual Plane, tcl/tk will use other fonts that define a
character.  The expanded example give users of non-Latin characters
a better idea of what they might see kwenye the shell na editors.

To make room kila the expanded sample, frames on the Font tab are
re-arranged.  The Font/Tabs help explains a bit about the additions.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy

bpo-31460: Simplify the API of IDLE's Module Browser.
Passing a widget instead of an flist ukijumuisha a root widget opens the
option of creating a browser frame that ni only part of a window.
Passing a full file name instead of pieces assumed to come kutoka a
.py file opens the possibility of browsing python files that do not
end kwenye .py.

bpo-31649: Make _htest na _utest parameters keyword-only.
These are used to adjust code kila human na unit tests.

bpo-31459: Rename module browser kutoka Class Browser to Module Browser.
The original module-level kundi na method browser became a module
browser, ukijumuisha the addition of module-level functions, years ago.
Nested classes na functions were added yesterday.  For back-
compatibility, the virtual event <<open-class-browser>>, which
appears on the Keys tab of the Settings dialog, ni sio changed.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-1612262: Module browser now shows nested classes na functions.
Original patches kila code na tests by Guilherme Polo and
Cheryl Sabella, respectively.  Revisions by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-31500: Tk's default fonts now are scaled on HiDPI displays.
This affects all dialogs.  Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

bpo-31493: Fix code context update na font update timers.
Canceling timers prevents a warning message when test_idle completes.

bpo-31488: Update non-key options kwenye former extension classes.
When applying configdialog changes, call .reload kila each feature class.
Change ParenMatch so updated options affect existing instances attached
to existing editor windows.

bpo-31477: Improve rstrip entry kwenye IDLE doc.
Strip Trailing Whitespace strips more than blank spaces.
Multiline string literals are sio skipped.

bpo-31480: fix tests to pita ukijumuisha zzdummy extension disabled. (#3590)
To see the example kwenye action, enable it on options extensions tab.

bpo-31421: Document how IDLE runs tkinter programs.
IDLE calls tcl/tk update kwenye the background kwenye order to make live
interaction na experimentation ukijumuisha tkinter applications much easier.

bpo-31414: Fix tk entry box tests by deleting first.
Adding to an int entry ni sio the same kama deleting na inserting
because int('') will fail.  Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-27099: Convert IDLE's built-in 'extensions' to regular features.
  About 10 IDLE features were implemented kama supposedly optional
extensions.  Their different behavior could be confusing ama worse for
users na sio good kila maintenance.  Hence the conversion.
  The main difference kila users ni that user configurable key bindings
kila builtin features are now handled uniformly.  Now, editing a binding
in a keyset only affects its value kwenye the keyset.  All bindings are
defined together kwenye the system-specific default keysets kwenye config-
extensions.def.  All custom keysets are saved kama a whole kwenye config-
extension.cfg.  All take effect kama soon kama one clicks Apply ama Ok.
   The affected events are '<<force-open-completions>>',
'<<expand-word>>', '<<force-open-calltip>>', '<<flash-paren>>',
'<<format-paragraph>>', '<<run-module>>', '<<check-module>>', and
'<<zoom-height>>'.  Any (global) customizations made before 3.6.3 will
not affect their keyset-specific customization after 3.6.3. na vice
versa.
  Initial patch by Charles Wohlganger, revised by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-31051:  Rearrange condigdialog General tab.
Sort non-Help options into Window (Shell+Editor) na Editor (only).
Leave room kila the addition of new options.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-30617: Add docstrings na tests kila outwin subkundi of editor.
Move some data na functions kutoka the kundi to module level.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31287: Do sio modify tkinter.messagebox kwenye test_configdialog.
Instead, mask it ukijumuisha an instance mock that can be deleted.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-30781: Use ttk widgets kwenye ConfigDialog pages.
These should especially look better on MacOSX.
Patches by Terry Jan Reedy na Cheryl Sabella.

The slightly modified tests endelea to pita.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31002: Add tests kila configdialog keys tab.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-19903: Change calltipes to use inspect.signature.
Idlelib.calltips.get_argspec now uses inspect.signature instead of
inspect.getfullargspec, like help() does.  This improves the signature
in the call tip kwenye a few different cases, including builtins converted
to provide a signature.  A message ni added ikiwa the object ni not
callable, has an invalid signature, ama ikiwa it has positional-only
parameters.  Patch by Louie Lu.

bop-31083: Add an outline of a TabPage kundi kwenye configdialog.
Add template kama comment. Update existing classes to match outline.
Initial patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31050: Factor GenPage(Frame) kundi kutoka ConfigDialog.

This improves navigation by tabbing.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-31060: IDLE - Finish rearranging methods of ConfigDialog.
Grouping methods pertaining to each tab na the buttons will aid

groups into classes.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-30853: IDLE -- Factor a VarTrace kundi out of ConfigDialog.

Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-31003: IDLE: Add more tests kila General tab.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-30993: IDLE - Improve configdialog font page na tests.

positions after the create widgets function.
* In test_configdialog: Fix test_font_set so sio order dependent.  Fix
renamed test_indent_scale so it tests the widget.  Adjust tests for
movement of set_samples call.  Add tests kila load functions.  Put all
font tests kwenye one kundi na tab indent tests kwenye another.  Except for
two lines, these tests completely cover the related functions.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.
