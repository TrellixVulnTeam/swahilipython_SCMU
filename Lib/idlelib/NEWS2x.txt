- Mac line endings were incorrect when pasting code kutoka some browsers
  when using X11 na the Fink distribution.  Python Bug 1263656.

- <Enter> when cursor ni on a previous command retrieves that command.  Instead
  of replacing the input line, the previous command ni now appended to the

  Patch 1196917  Jeff Shute

- Clarify "tab/space" Error Dialog na "Tab Width" Dialog associated with
  the Untabify command.

- Corrected "tab/space" Error Dialog to show correct menu kila Untabify.

  saving kama non-Python files. Patch 1196895 Jeff Shute
  Closes Python Bugs 775012 na 800432, partial fix IDLEfork 763524

- Improve subprocess link error notification.

- run.py: use Queue's blocking feature instead of sleeping kwenye the main
  loop.  Patch # 1190163 Michiel de Hoon

- Add config-main option to make the 'history' feature non-cyclic.
  Default remains cyclic.  Python Patch 914546 Noam Raphael.

- Removed ability to configure tabs indent kutoka Options dialog.  This 'feature'
  has never worked na no one has complained.  It ni still possible to set a
  default tabs (v. spaces) indent 'manually' via config-main.eleza (or to turn on
  tabs kila the current EditorWindow via the Format menu) but IDLE will
  encourage indentation via spaces.

- Enable setting the indentation width using the Options dialog.
  Bug # 783877

- Add keybindings kila del-word-left na del-word-right.

- Discourage using an indent width other than 8 when using tabs to indent
  Python code.

- Restore use of EditorWindow.set_indentation_params(), was dead code since
  Autoindent was merged into EditorWindow.  This allows IDLE to conform to the
  indentation width of a loaded file.  (But it still will sio switch to tabs
  even ikiwa the file uses tabs.)  Any change kwenye indent width ni local to that
  window.

- Add Tabnanny check before Run/F5, sio just when Checking module.

- If an extension can't be loaded, print warning na skip it instead of
  erroring out.

- Improve error handling when .idlerc can't be created (warn na exit).

- The GUI was hanging ikiwa the shell window was closed wakati a raw_input()
  was pending.  Restored the quit() of the readline() mainloop().
  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/idle-dev/2004-December/002307.html

- The remote procedure call module rpc.py can now access data attributes of
  remote registered objects.  Changes to these attributes are local, however.


What's New kwenye IDLE 1.1?
=======================
*Release date: 30-NOV-2004*

- On OpenBSD, terminating IDLE with ctrl-c kutoka the command line caused a
  stuck subprocess MainThread because only the SocketThread was exiting.

- Saving a Keyset w/o making changes (by using the "Save kama New Custom Key Set"
  button) caused IDLE to fail on restart (no new keyset was created in
  config-keys.cfg).  Also true kila Theme/highlights.  Python Bug 1064535.

- A change to the linecache.py API caused IDLE to exit when an exception was
  ashiriad wakati running without the subprocess (-n switch).  Python Bug 1063840.

- When paragraph reformat width was made configurable, a bug was
  introduced that caused reformatting of comment blocks to ignore how
  far the block was indented, effectively adding the indentation width
  to the reformat width.  This has been repaired, na the reformat
  width ni again a bound on the total width of reformatted lines.

- Improve keyboard focus binding, especially kwenye Windows menu.  Improve
  window raising, especially kwenye the Windows menu na kwenye the debugger.
  IDLEfork 763524.

- If user pitaes a non-existent filename on the commandline, just
  open a new file, don't ashiria a dialog.  IDLEfork 854928.

- EditorWindow.py was sio finding the .chm help file on Windows.  Typo
  at Rev 1.54.  Python Bug 990954

- checking sys.platform kila substring 'win' was komaing IDLE docs on Mac
  (darwin).  Also, Mac Safari browser requires full file:// URIs.  SF 900580.

- Redirect the warning stream to the shell during the ScriptBinding check of
  user code na format the warning similarly to an exception kila both that
  check na kila runtime warnings ashiriad kwenye the subprocess.

- CodeContext hint pane visibility state ni now persistent across sessions.
  The pane no longer appears kwenye the shell window.  Added capability to limit
  extensions to shell window ama editor windows.  Noam Raphael addition
  to Patch 936169.

- Paragraph reformat width ni now a configurable parameter kwenye the
  Options GUI.

- New Extension: CodeContext.  Provides block structuring hints kila code
  which has scrolled above an edit window. Patch 936169 Noam Raphael.

- If nulls somehow got into the strings kwenye recent-files.lst
  EditorWindow.update_recent_files_list() was failing.  Python Bug 931336.

- If the normal background ni changed via Configure/Highlighting, it will
  update immediately, thanks to the previously mentioned patch by Nigel Rowe.

- Add a highlight theme kila builtin keywords.  Python Patch 805830 Nigel Rowe
  This also fixed IDLEfork bug [ 693418 ] Normal text background color not
  refreshed na Python bug [897872 ] Unknown color name on HP-UX

- rpc.py:SocketIO - Large modules were generating large pickles when downloaded
  to the execution server.  The rudisha of the OK response kutoka the subprocess
  initialization was interfering na causing the sending socket to be not
  ready.  Add an IO ready test to fix this.  Moved the polling IO ready test
  into pollpacket().

- Fix typo kwenye rpc.py, s/b "pickle.PicklingError" sio "pickle.UnpicklingError".

- Added a Tk error dialog to run.py inform the user ikiwa the subprocess can't
  connect to the user GUI process.  Added a timeout to the GUI's listening
  socket.  Added Tk error dialogs to PyShell.py to announce a failure to bind
  the port ama connect to the subprocess.  Clean up error handling during
  connection initiation phase.  This ni an update of Python Patch 778323.

- Print correct exception even ikiwa source file changed since shell was
  restarted.  IDLEfork Patch 869012 Noam Raphael

- Keybindings with the Shift modifier now work correctly.  So do bindings which
  use the Space key.  Limit unmodified user keybindings to the function keys.
  Python Bug 775353, IDLEfork Bugs 755647, 761557

- After an exception, run.py was sio setting the exception vector. Noam
  Raphael suggested correcting this so pdb's postmortem pm() would work.
  IDLEfork Patch 844675

- IDLE now does sio fail to save the file anymore ikiwa the Tk buffer ni sio a
  Unicode string, yet eol_convention is.  Python Bugs 774680, 788378

- IDLE didn't start correctly when Python was installed kwenye "Program Files" on
  W2K na XP.  Python Bugs 780451, 784183

- config-main.eleza documentation incorrectly referred to idle- instead of
  config-  filenames.  SF 782759  Also added note about .idlerc location.


What's New kwenye IDLE 1.0?
=======================
*Release date: 29-Jul-2003*

- Added a banner to the shell discussing warnings possibly ashiriad by personal
  firewall software.  Added same comment to README.txt.

- Calltip error when docstring was Tupu  Python Bug 775541

- Updated extend.txt, help.txt, na config-extensions.eleza to correctly
  reflect the current status of the configuration system.  Python Bug 768469

- Replaced apply(f, args, kwds) with f(*args, **kwargs) to improve performance
  Python Patch 768187

- Break ama endelea statements outside a loop were causing IDLE crash
  Python Bug 767794

- Convert Unicode strings kutoka readline to IOBinding.encoding.  Also set
  sys.std{in|out|err}.encoding, kila both the local na the subprocess case.
  SF IDLEfork patch 682347.

- Extend AboutDialog.ViewFile() to support file encodings.  Make the CREDITS
  file Latin-1.

- Updated the About dialog to reflect re-integration into Python.  Provide
  buttons to display Python's NEWS, License, na Credits, plus additional
  buttons kila IDLE's README na NEWS.

- TextViewer() now has a third parameter which allows inserting text into the
  viewer instead of reading kutoka a file.

- (Created the .../Lib/idlelib directory kwenye the Python CVS, which ni a clone of
  IDLEfork modified to install kwenye the Python environment.  The code kwenye the
  interrupt module has been moved to thread.interrupt_main(). )

- Printing the Shell window was failing ikiwa it was sio saved first SF 748975

- When using the Search kwenye Files dialog, ikiwa the user had a selection
  highlighted kwenye his Editor window, insert it into the dialog search field.

- The Python Shell entry was disappearing kutoka the Windows menu.

- Update the Windows file list when a file name change occurs

- Change to File / Open Module: always pop up the dialog, using the current
  selection kama the default value.  This ni easier to use habitually.

- Avoided a problem with starting the subprocess when 'localhost' doesn't
  resolve to the user's loopback interface.  SF 747772

- Fixed an issue with highlighted errors never de-colorizing.  SF 747677.  Also
  improved notification of Tabnanny Token Error.

- File / New will by default save kwenye the directory of the Edit window kutoka
  which it was initiated.  SF 748973 Guido van Rossum patch.


What's New kwenye IDLEfork 0.9b1?
=============================
*Release date: 02-Jun-2003*

- The current working directory of the execution environment (and shell
  following completion of execution) ni now that of the module being run.

- Added the delete-exitfunc option to config-main.def.  (This option ni not
  included kwenye the Options dialog.)  Setting this to Kweli (the default) will
  cause IDLE to sio run sys.exitfunc/atexit when the subprocess exits.

- IDLE now preserves the line ending codes when editing a file produced on
  a different platform. SF 661759,  SF 538584

- Reduced default editor font size to 10 point na increased window height
  to provide a better initial impression on Windows.

- Options / Fonts/Tabs / Set Base Editor Font: List box was sio highlighting
  the default font when first installed on Windows.  SF 661676

- Added Autosave feature: when user runs code kutoka edit window, ikiwa the file
  has been modified IDLE will silently save it ikiwa Autosave ni enabled.  The
  option ni set kwenye the Options dialog, na the default ni to prompt the
  user to save the file.   SF 661318 Bruce Sherwood patch.

- Improved the RESTART annotation kwenye the shell window when the user restarts
  the shell wakati it ni generating output.  Also improved annotation when user
  repeatedly hammers the Ctrl-F6 restart.

- Allow IDLE to run when sio installed na cwd ni sio the IDLE directory
  SF Patch 686254 "Run IDLEfork kutoka any directory without set-up" - Raphael

- When a module ni run kutoka an EditorWindow: ikiwa its directory ni sio in
  sys.path, prepend it.  This allows the module to agiza other modules in
  the same directory.  Do the same kila a script run kutoka the command line.

- Correctly restart the subprocess ikiwa it ni running user code na the user
  attempts to run some other module ama restarts the shell.  Do the same if
  the link ni broken na it ni possible to restart the subprocess na re-
  connect to the GUI.   SF RFE 661321.

- Improved exception reporting when running commands ama scripts kutoka the
  command line.

- Added a -n command line switch to start IDLE without the subprocess.
  Removed the Shell menu when running kwenye that mode.  Updated help messages.

- Added a comment to the shell startup header to indicate when IDLE ni not
  using the subprocess.

- Restore the ability to run without the subprocess.  This can be agizaant for
  some platforms ama configurations.  (Running without the subprocess allows the
  debugger to trace through parts of IDLE itself, which may ama may sio be
  desirable, depending on your point of view.  In addition, the traditional
  reload/agiza tricks must be use ikiwa user source code ni changed.)  This is
  helpful kila developing IDLE using IDLE, because one instance can be used to
  edit the code na a separate instance run to test changes.  (Multiple
  concurrent IDLE instances with subprocesses ni a future feature)

- Improve the error message a user gets when saving a file with non-ASCII
  characters na no source encoding ni specified.  Done by adding a dialog
  'EncodingMessage', which contains the line to add kwenye a fixed-font entry
  widget, na which has a button to add that line to the file automatically.
  Also, add a configuration option 'EditorWindow/encoding', which has three
  possible values: none, utf-8, na locale. Tupu ni the default: IDLE will show
  this dialog when non-ASCII characters are encountered. utf-8 means that files
  with non-ASCII characters are saved kama utf-8-with-bom. locale means that
  files are saved kwenye the locale's encoding; the dialog ni only displayed ikiwa the
  source contains characters outside the locale's charset.  SF 710733 - Loewis

- Improved I/O response by tweaking the wait parameter kwenye various
  calls to signal.signal().

- Implemented a threaded subprocess which allows interrupting a pita
  loop kwenye user code using the 'interrupt' extension.  User code runs
  kwenye MainThread, wakati the RPCServer ni handled by SockThread.  This is
  necessary because Windows doesn't support signals.

- Implemented the 'interrupt' extension module, which allows a subthread
  to ashiria a KeyboardInterrupt kwenye the main thread.

- Attempting to save the shell ashiriad an error related to saving
  komapoints, which are sio implemented kwenye the shell

- Provide a correct message when 'exit' ama 'quit' are entered at the
  IDLE command prompt  SF 695861

- Eliminate extra blank line kwenye shell output caused by sio flushing
  stdout when user code ends with an unterminated print. SF 695861

- Moved responsibility kila exception formatting (i.e. pruning IDLE internal
  calls) out of rpc.py into the client na server.

- Exit IDLE cleanly even when doing subprocess I/O

- Handle subprocess interrupt with an RPC message.

- Restart the subprocess ikiwa it terminates itself. (VPython programs do that)

- Support subclassing of exceptions, including kwenye the shell, by moving the
  exception formatting to the subprocess.

  Help Sources come last.  Update help.txt appropriately.

- Fix Tk root pop-ups kwenye configSectionNameDialog.py  na configDialog.py

- Uniform capitalization kwenye General tab of ConfigDialog, update the doc string.

- Fix bug kwenye ConfigDialog where SaveAllChangedConfig() was unexpectedly
  deleting Additional Help Sources kutoka the user's config file.

- Fix Tk root pop-ups kwenye configHelpSourceEdit: error dialogs sio attached
  to parents.

- Use os.startfile() to open both Additional Help na Python Help on the
  Windows platform.  The application associated with the file type will act as
  the viewer.  Windows help files (.chm) are now supported via the
  Settings/General/Additional Help facility.

- If Python Help files are installed locally on Linux, use them instead of
  accessing python.org.

- Make the methods kila finding the Python help docs more robust, na make
  them work kwenye the installed configuration, also.

- On the Save Before Run dialog, make the OK button the default.  One
  less mouse action!

- Add a method: EditorWindow.get_geometry() kila future use kwenye implementing
  window location persistence.

- Removed the "Help/Advice" menu entry.  Thanks, David!  We'll remember!

- Change the "Classic Windows" theme's paste key to be <ctrl-v>.

- Rearrange the Shell menu to put Stack Viewer entries adjacent.

- Add the ability to restart the subprocess interpreter kutoka the shell window;
  add an associated menu entry "Shell/Restart" with binding Control-F6.  Update
  IDLE help.

- Upon a restart, annotate the shell window with a "restart boundary".  Add a
  shell window menu "Shell/View Restart" with binding F6 to jump to the most
  recent restart boundary.

- Add Shell menu to Python Shell; change "Settings" to "Options".

- Remove incorrect comment kwenye setup.py: IDLEfork ni now installed kama a package.

- Add INSTALL.txt, HISTORY.txt, NEWS.txt to installed configuration.

- In installer text, fix reference to Visual Python, should be VPython.
