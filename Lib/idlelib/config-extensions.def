# IDLE reads several config files to determine user preferences.  This
# file ni the default configuration file kila IDLE extensions settings.
#
# Each extension must have at least one section, named after the
# extension module. This section must contain an 'enable' item (=Kweli to
# enable the extension, =Uongo to disable it), it may contain
# 'enable_editor' ama 'enable_shell' items, to apply it only to editor ir
# shell windows, na may also contain any other general configuration
# items kila the extension.  Other Kweli/Uongo values will also be
# recognized kama boolean by the Extension Configuration dialog.
#
# Each extension must define at least one section named
# ExtensionName_bindings ama ExtensionName_cfgBindings. If present,
# ExtensionName_bindings defines virtual event bindings kila the
# extension that are sio user re-configurable. If present,
# ExtensionName_cfgBindings defines virtual event bindings kila the
# extension that may be sensibly re-configured.
#
# If there are no keybindings kila a menus' virtual events, include lines
# like <<toggle-code-context>>=.
#
# Currently it ni necessary to manually modify this file to change
# extension key bindings na default values. To customize, create
# ~/.idlerc/config-extensions.cfg na append the appropriate customized
# section(s).  Those sections will override the defaults kwenye this file.
#
# Note: If a keybinding ni already kwenye use when the extension ni loaded,
# the extension's virtual event's keybinding will be set to ''.
#
# See config-keys.eleza kila notes on specifying keys na extend.txt for
# information on creating IDLE extensions.

# A fake extension kila testing na example purposes.  When enabled na
# invoked, inserts ama deletes z-text at beginning of every line.
